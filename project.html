<h2>Practical Machine Learning - Project</h2>

<p>The project data contains about 160 columns. The prediction is on the classe variable which has five classes A,B,C,D and E.
Looking at the 160 columns it could be found that many are average,standard deviation,skewness,kurtosis etc. of 12 variables.
Plotting three of them agains different classes show that these would provide good classifiers.</p>

<p>I used all these 12 variables centered and scaled them and used random forests to predict.
I divided the samples into 70% training and 30% test. I did not do any seperate cross-validation in random forests.
The following is quoted from Random Forests Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler </p> <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm">Random Forest</a> 

<p>"In random forests, there is no need for cross-validation or a separate test set to get an unbiased estimate of the test set error. It is estimated internally, during the run, as follows:
Each tree is constructed using a different bootstrap sample from the original data. About one-third of the cases are left out of the bootstrap sample and not used in the construction of the kth tree."

<p>The confusion matrix is given here. As the accuracy is 0.9873, I did not do any further changes to the prediction method.</p>
